# Enhancing Visual Encoder Self-Supervised Pre-training With OOD Detector

This project presents a novel framework that integrates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection into self-supervised learning (SSL) pipelines, aiming to improve representation learning for rare objects in long-tailed datasets such as autonomous driving video frames. By dynamically detecting and incorporating rare samples into training using a memory buffer, the model achieves better generalization and performance on underrepresented classes.

## üîç Motivation

Conventional SSL models (e.g., SimCLR, DINO) perform poorly on long-tailed distributions where frequent classes dominate. In safety-critical domains like autonomous driving, underrepresenting rare objects (e.g., pedestrians, traffic signs) leads to suboptimal feature learning. This project addresses this gap by detecting rare examples using a flexible distance-based OOD detector and reintroducing them into training via a memory buffer.

## üöÄ Key Contributions

- **OOD-Enhanced SSL Pipeline**: Embedding-based OOD detection flags rare samples for prioritization.
- **Dynamic Memory Buffer**: Stores OOD-flagged samples for repeated training exposure.
- **DINO Integration**: Combines rare and regular samples during self-supervised training.
- **Empirical Evaluation**: Shows improved rare-object recognition on BDD100K and ImageNet subsets.

## üß† Method Overview

1. **Embedding Extraction**: A ResNet-50 encoder pretrained with DINO is used to extract features.
2. **OOD Detection**: Samples with high embedding distance from the mean are flagged as rare.
3. **Memory Buffer**: FIFO queue stores and updates rare samples throughout training.
4. **Self-Supervised Training**: Augmented batches include rare samples for DINO training.
